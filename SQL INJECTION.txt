SQL injection is a cybersecurity vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields of a web application, exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's SQL queries. This allows the attacker to manipulate the database, steal sensitive information, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary commands.

Attackers exploit SQL injection by inserting specially crafted SQL commands into input fields, such as login forms, search boxes, or URL parameters. These commands can bypass authentication mechanisms, extract data from the database, or perform unauthorized actions.

There are several types of SQL injection attacks, including:

1. **Classic SQL Injection**: Involves inserting malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database directly.

2. **Blind SQL Injection**: Exploits vulnerabilities where the application doesn't respond differently based on the result of the injected SQL query, making it harder to detect.

3. **Union-Based SQL Injection**: Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from two or more SELECT statements, allowing attackers to retrieve data from other tables.

4. **Error-Based SQL Injection**: Relies on error messages generated by the database server to extract information about the structure of the database.

5. **Time-Based SQL Injection**: Exploits time delays in database operations to infer information about the database.

To prevent SQL injection attacks, developers should implement the following best practices:

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound parameters to separate SQL code from data, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize input data to ensure it meets expected criteria before executing SQL queries.

3. **Least Privilege**: Limit database user privileges to only those necessary for the application to function, reducing the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

4. **Escaping User Input**: Escape special characters in user input before incorporating them into SQL queries to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL commands.

5. **Database Firewalls**: Implement database firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block suspicious SQL injection attempts.

By following these best practices and regularly updating and patching applications, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect their sensitive data.
